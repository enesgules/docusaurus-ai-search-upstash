## Introduction
This quickstart will guide you through setting up QStash to run a daily script
to clean up your database. This is useful for testing and development environments
where you want to reset the database every day.
## Prerequisites
- Create an Upstash account and get your [QStash token](https://console.upstash.com/qstash)
Now, go ahead and try it out for yourself! Try using some of the other features of QStash, such as
[callbacks](/qstash/features/callbacks) and [URL Groups](/qstash/features/url-groups).
