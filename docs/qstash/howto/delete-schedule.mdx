title: "Delete Schedules"
---
Deleting schedules can be done using the [schedules api](/qstash/api/schedules/remove).
Deleting a schedule does not stop existing messages from being delivered. It
only stops the schedule from creating new messages.
## Schedule ID
If you don't know the schedule ID, you can get a list of all of your schedules
from [here](/qstash/api/schedules/list).
