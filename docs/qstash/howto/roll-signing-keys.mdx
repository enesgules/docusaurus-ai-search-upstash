title: "Roll Your Signing Keys"
---
Because your API needs to be publicly accessible from the internet, you should
make sure to verify the authenticity of each request.
Upstash provides a JWT with each request. This JWT is signed by your individual
secret signing keys. [Read more](/qstash/howto/signature).
We are using 2 signing keys:
- current: This is the key used to sign the JWT.
- next: This key will be used to sign after you have rolled your keys.
If we were using only a single key, there would be some time between when you
rolled your keys and when you can edit the key in your applications. In order to
minimize downtime, we use 2 keys and you should always try to verify with both
keys.
## What happens when I roll my keys?
When you roll your keys, the current key will be replaced with the next key and
a new next key will be generated.
```
currentKey = nextKey
nextKey = generateNewKey()
```
## How to roll your keys
Rolling your keys can be done by going to the
[QStash UI](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and clicking on the "Roll keys"
button.
