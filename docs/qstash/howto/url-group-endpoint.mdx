title: "Create URL Groups and Endpoints"
---
QStash allows you to group multiple APIs together into a single namespace,
called a `URL Group` (Previously, it was called `Topics`).
Read more about URL Groups [here](/qstash/features/url-groups).
There are two ways to create endpoints and URL Groups: The UI and the REST API.
## UI
Go to [console.upstash.com/qstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and click
on the `URL Groups` tab. Afterwards you can create a new URL Group by giving it a name.
Keep in mind that URL Group names are restricted to alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen
and dot characters.

After creating the URL Group, you can add endpoints to it:

## API
You can create a URL Group and endpoint using the [console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) or [REST API](/qstash/api/url-groups/add-endpoint).
