title: "Bulk Cancel Messages"
---
Bulk cancel allows you to cancel multiple messages at once.
This operation scans all your messages and attempts to cancel them.
If an individual message cannot be cancelled, it will not continue and will return an error message.
Therefore, some messages may not be cancelled at the end.
In such cases, you can run the bulk cancel operation multiple times.
## Request
## Response
A cancelled object with the number of cancelled messages.
```JSON
{
  "cancelled": number
}
```
