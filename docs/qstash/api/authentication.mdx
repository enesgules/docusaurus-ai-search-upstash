You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the
QStash API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works.
## Bearer Token
When making requests to QStash, you will need your `QSTASH_TOKEN` â€” you will
find it in the [console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash). Here's how to add
the token to the request header using cURL:
```bash
curl https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/... \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <QSTASH_TOKEN>"
```
## Query Parameter
In environments where setting the header is not possible, you can use the `qstash_token` query parameter instead.
```bash
curl https://qstash.upstash.io/v2/publish/...?qstash_token=<QSTASH_TOKEN>
```
Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
