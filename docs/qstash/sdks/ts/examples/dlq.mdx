#### Get all messages with pagination using cursor
Since the DLQ can have a large number of messages, they are paginated.
You can go through the results using the `cursor`.
```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";
const client = new Client("<QSTASH_TOKEN>");
const dlq = client.dlq;
const all_messages = [];
let cursor = null;
while (true) {
  const res = await dlq.listMessages({ cursor });
  all_messages.push(...res.messages);
  cursor = res.cursor;
  if (!cursor) {
    break;
  }
}
```
#### Delete a message from the DLQ
```typescript
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const dlq = client.dlq;
await dlq.delete("dlqId");
```
