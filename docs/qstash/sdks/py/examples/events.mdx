#### Get all events with pagination using cursor
Since there can be a large number of events, they are paginated.
You can go through the results using the `cursor`.
```python
from qstash import QStash
client = QStash("<QSTASH-TOKEN>")
all_events = []
cursor = None
while True:
    res = client.event.list(cursor=cursor)
    all_events.extend(res.events)
    cursor = res.cursor
    if cursor is None:
        break
```
