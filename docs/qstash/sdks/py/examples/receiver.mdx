When receiving a message from QStash, you should [verify the signature](/qstash/howto/signature).
The QStash Python SDK provides a helper function for this.
```python
from qstash import Receiver
receiver = Receiver(
    current_signing_key="YOUR_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY",
    next_signing_key="YOUR_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY",
)
# ... in your request handler
signature, body = req.headers["Upstash-Signature"], req.body
receiver.verify(
    body=body,
    signature=signature,
    url="YOUR-SITE-URL",
)
```
