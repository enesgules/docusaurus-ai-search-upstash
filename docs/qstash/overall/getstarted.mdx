QStash is a **serverless messaging and scheduling solution**. It fits easily into your existing workflow and allows you to build reliable systems without managing infrastructure.
Instead of calling an endpoint directly, QStash acts as a middleman between you and an API to guarantee delivery, perform automatic retries on failure, and more.
## Quick Start
Check out these Quick Start guides to get started with QStash in your application.

## Send your first message
### Public API
Make sure you have a publicly available HTTP API that you want to send your
messages to. If you don't, you can use something like
[requestcatcher.com](https://requestcatcher.com/), [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) or
[webhook-test.com](https://webhook-test.com/) to try it out.
For example, you can use this URL to test your messages: [https://firstqstashmessage.requestcatcher.com](https://firstqstashmessage.requestcatcher.com)
### Get your token
Go to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the
`QSTASH_TOKEN`.
### Publish a message
A message can be any shape or form: json, xml, binary, anything, that can be
transmitted in the http request body. We do not impose any restrictions other
than a size limit of 1 MB (which can be customized at your request).
In addition to the request body itself, you can also send HTTP headers. Learn
more about this in the [message publishing section](/qstash/howto/publishing).
Don't worry, we have SDKs for different languages so you don't
have to make these requests manually.
### Check Response
You should receive a response with a unique message ID.
### Check Message Status
Head over to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and go to the
`Events` tab where you can see your message activities.
Learn more about different states [here](/qstash/howto/debug-logs).
