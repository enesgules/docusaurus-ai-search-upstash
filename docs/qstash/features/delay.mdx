title: "Delay"
---
When publishing a message, you can delay it for a certain amount of time before
it will be delivered to your API. See the [pricing table](https://upstash.com/pricing/qstash) for more information
## Relative Delay
Delay a message by a certain amount of time relative to the time the message was
published.
The format for the duration is `<number><unit>`. Here are some examples:
- `10s` = 10 seconds
- `1m` = 1 minute
- `30m` = half an hour
- `2h` = 2 hours
- `7d` = 7 days
You can send this duration inside the `Upstash-Delay` header.
## Absolute Delay
Delay a message until a certain time in the future. The format is a unix
timestamp in seconds, based on the UTC timezone.
You can send the timestamp inside the `Upstash-Not-Before` header.
## Delays in Schedules
Adding a delay in schedules is only possible via `Upstash-Delay`. The
delay will affect the messages that will be created by the schedule and not the
schedule itself.
For example when you create a new schedule with a delay of `30s`, the messages
will be created when the schedule triggers but only delivered after 30 seconds.
