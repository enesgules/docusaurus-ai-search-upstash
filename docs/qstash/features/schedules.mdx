In addition to sending a message once, you can create a schedule, and we will
publish the message in the given period. To create a schedule, you simply need
to add the `Upstash-Cron` header to your `publish` request.
Schedules can be configured using `cron` expressions.
[crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) is a great tool for understanding and
creating cron expressions.
We use `UTC` as timezone when evaluating cron expressions.
The following request would create a schedule that will automatically publish
the message every minute:
All of the [other config options](/qstash/howto/publishing#optional-parameters-and-configuration)
can still be used.
You can see and manage your schedules in the
[Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash).
### Scheduling to a URL Group
Instead of scheduling a message to a specific URL, you can also create a
schedule, that publishes to a URL Group. Simply use either the URL Group name or its id:
### Scheduling to a Queue
You can schedule an item to be added to a queue at a specified time.
### Overwriting an existing schedule
You can pass scheduleId explicitly to overwrite an existing schedule or just simply create the schedule
with the given schedule id.
