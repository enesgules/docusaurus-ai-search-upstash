[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) allows you to build and run workflows with
1000s of open source triggers and actions across 900+ apps.
Check out the [official integration](https://pipedream.com/apps/qstash).
## Trigger a Pipedream workflow from a QStash topic message
This is a step by step guide on how to trigger a Pipedream workflow from a
QStash topic message.
Alternatively [click here](https://pipedream.com/new?h=tch_3egfAX) to create a
new workflow with this QStash topic trigger added.
### 1. Create a Topic in QStash
If you haven't yet already, create a **Topic** in the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=topics).
### 2. Create a new Pipedream workflow
Sign into [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) and create a new workflow.
### 3. Add QStash Topic Message as a trigger
In the workflow **Trigger** search for QStash and select the **Create Topic
Endpoint** trigger.
![Select the QStash Create Topic Endpoint trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664298855/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_13.13.56_x6gzgk.gif)
Then, connect your QStash account by clicking the QStash prop and retrieving
your token from the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=details).
After connecting your QStash account, click the **Topic** prop, a dropdown will
appear containing the QStash topics on your account.
Then _click_ on a specific topic to listen for new messages on.
![Selecting a QStash topic to subscribe to](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664299016/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_13.16.35_rewzbo.gif)
Finally, _click_ **Continue**. Pipedream will create a unique HTTP endpoint and
add it to your QStash topic.
### 4. Test with a sample message
Use the _Request Builder_ in the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=details) to publish a
test message to your topic.
Alternatively, you can use the **Create topic message** action in a Pipedream
workflow to send a message to your topic.
_Don't forget_ to use this action in a separate workflow, otherwise you might
cause an infinite loop of messages between QStash and Pipedream.
### 5. Add additional steps
Add additional steps to the workflow by clicking the plus icon beneath the
Trigger step.
Build a workflow with the 1,000+ pre-built components available in Pipedream,
including [Airtable](https://pipedream.com/apps/airtable),
[Google Sheets](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-sheets),
[Slack](https://pipedream.com/apps/slack) and many more.
Alternatively, use [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs) or
[Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python) code steps to retrieve,
transform, or send data to other services.
### 6. Deploy your Pipedream workflow
After you're satisfied with your changes, click the **Deploy** button in the
top right of your Pipedream workflow. Your deployed workflow will not
automatically process new messages to your QStash topic. Collapse

## Trigger a Pipedream workflow from a QStash topic message
This is a step by step guide on how to trigger a Pipedream workflow from a
QStash endpoint message.
Alternatively [click here](https://pipedream.com/new?h=tch_m5ofX6) to create a
pre-configured workflow with the HTTP trigger and QStash webhook verification
step already added.
### 1. Create a new Pipedream workflow
Sign into [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) and create a new workflow.
### 2. Configure the workflow with an HTTP trigger
In the workflow **Trigger** select the **New HTTP / Webhook Requests** option.
![Create new HTTP Webhook trigger](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664296111/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_12.27.42_cqzolg.png)
Pipedream will create a unique HTTP endpoint for your workflow.
Then configure the HTTP trigger to _return a custom response_. By default
Pipedream will always return a 200 response, which allows us to return a non-200
response to QStash to retry the workflow again if there's an error during the
execution of the QStash message.
![Configure the webhook to return a custom response](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664296210/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_12.29.45_jbwtcm.png)
Lastly, set the **Event Body** to be a **Raw request**. This will make sure the
QStash verify webhook action receives the data in the correct format.
![Set the event body to a raw body](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664302540/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_14.15.15_o4xinz.png)
### 3. Test with a sample message
Use the _Request Builder_ in the
[QStash dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/qstash?tab=details) to publish a
test message to your topic.
Alternatively, you can use the **Create topic message** action in a Pipedream
workflow to send a message to your topic.
_Don't forget_ to use this action in a separate workflow, otherwise you might
cause an infinite loop of messages between QStash and Pipedream.
### 4. Verify the QStash webhook
Pipedream has a pre-built QStash action that will verify the content of incoming
webhooks from QStash.
First, search for **QStash** in the step search bar, then select the QStash app.
Of the available actions, select the **Verify Webhook** action.
Then connect your QStash account and select the **HTTP request** prop. In the
dropdown, click **Enter custom expression** and then paste in
`{{ steps.trigger.event }}`.
This step will automatically verify the incoming HTTP requests and exit the
workflow early if requests are not from QStash.
### 5. Add additional steps
Add additional steps to the workflow by clicking the plus icon beneath the
Trigger step.
Build a workflow with the 1,000+ pre-built components available in Pipedream,
including [Airtable](https://pipedream.com/apps/airtable),
[Google Sheets](https://pipedream.com/apps/google-sheets),
[Slack](https://pipedream.com/apps/slack) and many more.
Alternatively, use [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs) or
[Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python) code steps to retrieve,
transform, or send data to other services.
### 6. Return a 200 response
In the final step of your workflow, return a 200 response by adding a new step
and selecting **Return an HTTP Response**.
![Returning an HTTP response](https://res.cloudinary.com/pipedreamin/image/upload/v1664296812/docs/components/CleanShot_2022-09-27_at_12.39.25_apkngf.png)
This will generate Node.js code to return an HTTP response to QStash using the
`$.respond` helper in Pipedream.
### 7. Deploy your Pipedream workflow
After you're satisfied with your changes, click the **Deploy** button in the
top right of your Pipedream workflow. Your deployed workflow will not
automatically process new messages to your QStash topic.
