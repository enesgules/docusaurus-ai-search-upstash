title: "Upgrade Your Database"
---
Free tier has followings restrictions:
- Max 10.000 requests per day
- Max 256 MB data size
- Max 1 database
If you think your database is close to reaching any of these limits, we
recommend you to upgrade to pay-as-you-go plan which includes:
- No limit on requests per day
- Data size up to 10 GB
To upgrade your database, you need to have a payment method. You can add a
payment method as described [here](/common/account/addapaymentmethod). After you add
a payment method, Upstash restarts your database and your new database starts
with the pay-as-you-go plan.
See the [quotas](https://upstash.com/pricing/redis) for limits of the
pay-as-you-go plan. If you think, your use case will exceed those quotas,
contact us (support@upstash.com) for our [Enterprise Plan](#enterprise-plan)
where you can customize the limits.
