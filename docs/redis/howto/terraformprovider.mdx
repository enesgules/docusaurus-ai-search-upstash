  email = ""
  api_key = ""
}
```
### Create Database

```
resource "upstash_database" "mydb" {
  database_name = "testdblstr"
  region = "eu-west-1"
  type = "free"
}
```
You can output database credentials as following
```
output "endpoint" {
  value = "${upstash_database.mydb.endpoint}"
}
output "port" {
