## Block until ready
You also have the option to try and wait for a request to pass in the given
timeout.
It is very similar to the `limit` method and takes an identifier and returns the
same response. However if the current limit has already been exceeded, it will
automatically wait until the next window starts and will try again. Setting the
timeout parameter (in seconds) will cause the method to block a finite amount of
time.
```python
from upstash_ratelimit import Ratelimit, SlidingWindow
from upstash_redis import Redis
# Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds
ratelimit = Ratelimit(
    redis=Redis.from_env(),
    limiter=SlidingWindow(max_requests=10, window=10),
)
response = ratelimit.block_until_ready("id", timeout=30)
if not response.allowed:
    print("Unable to process, even after 30 seconds")
else:
    do_expensive_calculation()
    print("Here you go!")
```
## Using multiple limits
Sometimes you might want to apply different limits to different users. For
example you might want to allow 10 requests per 10 seconds for free users, but
60 requests per 10 seconds for paid users.
Here's how you could do that:
```python
from upstash_ratelimit import Ratelimit, SlidingWindow
from upstash_redis import Redis
class MultiRL:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        redis = Redis.from_env()
        self.free = Ratelimit(
            redis=redis,
            limiter=SlidingWindow(max_requests=10, window=10),
            prefix="ratelimit:free",
        )
        self.paid = Ratelimit(
            redis=redis,
            limiter=SlidingWindow(max_requests=60, window=10),
            prefix="ratelimit:paid",
        )
# Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds
ratelimit = MultiRL()
ratelimit.free.limit("userIP")
ratelimit.paid.limit("userIP")
```
## Custom Rates
When rate limiting, you may want different requests to consume different amounts of tokens.
This could be useful when processing batches of requests where you want to rate limit based
on items in the batch or when you want to rate limit based on the number of tokens.
To achieve this, you can simply pass `rate` parameter when calling the limit method:
```python
from upstash_ratelimit import Ratelimit, FixedWindow
from upstash_redis import Redis
ratelimit = Ratelimit(
    redis=Redis.from_env(),
    limiter=FixedWindow(max_requests=10, window=10),
)
# pass rate as 5 to subtract 5 from the number of
# allowed requests in the window:
identifier = "api"
response = ratelimit.limit(identifier, rate=5)
```
