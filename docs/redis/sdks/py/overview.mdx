`upstash-redis` is a connectionless, HTTP-based Redis client for Python,
designed to be used in serverless and serverful environments such as:
- AWS Lambda
- Vercel Serverless
- Google Cloud Functions
- and other environments where HTTP is preferred over TCP.
Inspired by other Redis clients like
[@upstash/redis](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis) and
[redis-py](https://github.com/redis/redis-py), the goal of this SDK is to
provide a simple way to use Redis over the
[Upstash REST API](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/features/restapi).
The SDK is currently compatible with Python 3.8 and above.
