title: "Developing or Testing"
---
When developing or testing your application, you might not want or can not use
Upstash over the internet. In this case, you can use a community project called
[Serverless Redis HTTP (SRH)](https://github.com/hiett/serverless-redis-http)
created by [Scott Hiett](https://x.com/hiettdigital).
SRH is a Redis proxy and connection pooler that uses HTTP rather than the Redis
binary protocol. The aim of this project is to be entirely compatible with
Upstash, and work with any Upstash supported Redis version.
We are working with Scott together to keep SRH up to date with the latest
Upstash features.
## Use cases for SRH:
- For usage in your CI pipelines, creating Upstash databases is tedious, or you
  have lots of parallel runs.
  - See [Using in GitHub Actions](#in-github-actions) on how to quickly get SRH
    setup for this context.
- For usage inside of Kubernetes, or any network whereby the Redis server is not
  exposed to the internet.
  - See [Using in Docker Compose](#via-docker-compose) for the various setup
    options directly using the Docker Container.
- For local development environments, where you have a local Redis server
  running, or require offline access.
  - See [Using the Docker Command](#via-docker-command), or
    [Using Docker Compose](#via-docker-compose).
## Setting up SRH
### Via Docker command
If you have a locally running Redis server, you can simply start an SRH
container that connects to it. In this example, SRH will be running on port
`8080`.
```bash
docker run \
    -it -d -p 8080:80 --name srh \
    -e SRH_MODE=env \
    -e SRH_TOKEN=your_token_here \
    -e SRH_CONNECTION_STRING="redis://your_server_here:6379" \
    hiett/serverless-redis-http:latest
```
### Via Docker Compose
If you wish to run in Kubernetes, this should contain all the basics would need
to set that up. However, be sure to read the Configuration Options, because you
can create a setup whereby multiple Redis servers are proxied.
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
  serverless-redis-http:
    ports:
      - "8079:80"
    image: hiett/serverless-redis-http:latest
    environment:
      SRH_MODE: env
      SRH_TOKEN: example_token
      SRH_CONNECTION_STRING: "redis://redis:6379" # Using `redis` hostname since they're in the same Docker network.
```
### In GitHub Actions
SRH works nicely in GitHub Actions because you can run it as a container in a
job's services. Simply start a Redis server, and then SRH alongside it. You
don't need to worry about a race condition of the Redis instance not being
ready, because SRH doesn't create a Redis connection until the first command
comes in.
```yml
name: Test @upstash/redis compatibility
on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:
env:
  SRH_TOKEN: example_token
jobs:
  container-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: denoland/deno
    services:
      redis:
        image: redis/redis-stack-server:6.2.6-v6 # 6.2 is the Upstash compatible Redis version
      srh:
        image: hiett/serverless-redis-http:latest
        env:
          SRH_MODE: env # We are using env mode because we are only connecting to one server.
          SRH_TOKEN: ${{ env.SRH_TOKEN }}
          SRH_CONNECTION_STRING: redis://redis:6379
    steps:
      # You can place your normal testing steps here. In this example, we are running SRH against the upstash/upstash-redis test suite.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          repository: upstash/upstash-redis
      - name: Run @upstash/redis Test Suite
        run: deno test -A ./pkg
        env:
          UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL: http://srh:80
          UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN: ${{ env.SRH_TOKEN }}
```
A huge thanks goes out to [Scott](https://hiett.dev/) for creating this project,
and for his continued efforts to keep it up to date with Upstash.
