## MGET
Load multiple keys at once. For billing purposes, this counts as a single command.
If a key is not found, it will be returned as `null`, so you might end up with `null` values in your response array.
```ts
const values = await redis.mget("key1", "key2", "key3");
```
## MSET
Set multiple values at once. For billing purposes, this counts as a single command.
```ts
await redis.mset({
  key1: { a: 1 },
  key2: "value2",
  key3: true,
});
```
