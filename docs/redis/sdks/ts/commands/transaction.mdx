You can use transactions or pipelines with the `multi` or `pipeline` method.
Transactions are executed atomically, while pipelines are not. In pipelines you can execute multiple commands at once, but other commands from other clients can be executed in between.
For more information on pipelines and transactions, see
[the Pipeline page](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/ts/pipelining/pipeline-transaction).
