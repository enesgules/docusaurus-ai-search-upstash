### Pipeline
Pipelining commands allows you to send a single http request with multiple
commands. Keep in mind, that the execution of pipelines is not atomic and the
execution of other commands can interleave.
```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
const redis = new Redis({
  /* auth */
});
const p = redis.pipeline();
// Now you can chain multiple commands to create your pipeline:
p.set("key", 2);
p.incr("key");
// or inline:
p.hset("key2", "field", { hello: "world" }).hvals("key2");
// Execute the pipeline once you are done building it:
// `exec` returns an array where each element represents the response of a command in the pipeline.
// You can optionally provide a type like this to get a typed response.
const res = await p.exec<[Type1, Type2, Type3]>();
```
For more information about pipelines using REST see
[here](https://blog.upstash.com/pipeline).
If you wish to benefit from pipeline automatically,
you can simply enable auto-pipelining to make your redis client
handle the commands in batches in the background. See
[the Auto-pipelining page](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/sdks/ts/pipelining/auto-pipeline).
### Transaction
Remember that the pipeline is able to send multiple commands at once but
can't execute them atomically. With transactions, you can make the commands
execute atomically.
```ts
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
const redis = new Redis({
  /* auth */
});
const p = redis.multi();
p.set("key", 2);
p.incr("key");
// or inline:
p.hset("key2", "field", { hello: "world" }).hvals("key2");
// execute the transaction
const res = await p.exec<[Type1, Type2, Type3]>();
```
