### Database Setup
Create a Redis database using [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) or
[Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli). Select the global to minimize the
latency from all edge locations. Copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` for the next steps.
### Project Setup
We will use Fastly CLI for deployment, so please install
[Fastly CLI](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/cli/).
Create a folder for your project and run `fastly init`. Select `[2] JavaScript`,
then `[2] Empty starter for JavaScript`
```shell
> fastly compute init
Creating a new Compute@Edge project.
Press ^C at any time to quit.
Name: [fastly-upstash]
Description:
Author: [enes@upstash.com]
Language:
[1] Rust
[2] JavaScript
[3] AssemblyScript (beta)
[4] Other ('bring your own' Wasm binary)
Choose option: [1] 2
Starter kit:
[1] Default starter for JavaScript
    A basic starter kit that demonstrates routing, simple synthetic responses and
    overriding caching rules.
    https://github.com/fastly/compute-starter-kit-javascript-default
[2] Empty starter for JavaScript
    An empty application template for the Fastly Compute@Edge environment which simply
    returns a 200 OK response.
    https://github.com/fastly/compute-starter-kit-javascript-empty
Choose option or paste git URL: [1] 2
```
Install @upstash/redis:
```shell
npm install @upstash/redis
```
Now, we will create a Fastly Compute service by running,
`fastly compute publish`. You need to add your Upstash database's endpoint as a
backend and select 443 as its port.
```shell
> fastly compute publish

There is no Fastly service associated with this package. To connect to an existing service
add the Service ID to the fastly.toml file, otherwise follow the prompts to create a
service now.

```
### The Code
Update `src/index.js` as below:
```js
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis/fastly";
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => event.respondWith(handleRequest(event)));
async function handleRequest(event) {
  const redis = new Redis({
    url: "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL",
    token: "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN",
    backend: "upstash",
  });
  const data = await redis.incr("count");
  return new Response("View Count:" + data, { status: 200 });
}
```
### Deploy
Deploy: `fastly compute deploy`
After deployment, the CLI logs the endpoint. You can check the logs with:
`fastly log-tail --service-id=<YOUR_FASTLY_SERVICE_ID>`
### Run Locally
To run the function locally add the backend to your `fastly.toml` as below:
```toml
[local_server.backends.upstash]
url = "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL"
```
Then run: `fastly compute serve`
