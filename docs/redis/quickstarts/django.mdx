### Introduction
In this quickstart tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use Django with Upstash Redis to build a simple web application that increments a counter every time the homepage is accessed.
### Environment Setup
First, install Django and the Upstash Redis client for Python:
```shell
pip install django
pip install upstash-redis
```
### Database Setup
Create a Redis database using the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) or [Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli) and export the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to your environment:
```shell
export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=<YOUR_URL>
export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```
You can also use `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from your `.env` file.
### Project Setup
Create a new Django project:
```shell
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp
```
In `myproject/settings.py`, add your new app (`myapp`) to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
### Application Setup
In `myapp/views.py`, add the following:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from upstash_redis import Redis
redis = Redis.from_env()
def index(request):
    count = redis.incr('counter')
    return HttpResponse(f'Page visited {count} times.')
```
In `myproject/urls.py`, connect the view to a URL pattern:
```python
from django.urls import path
from myapp import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index),
]
```
### Running the Application
Run the development server:
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser, and the counter will increment with each page refresh.
### Code Breakdown
1. **Redis Setup**: We use the Upstash Redis client to connect to our Redis database using the environment variables `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`. The `Redis.from_env()` method initializes this connection.
2. **Increment Counter**: In the `index` view, we increment the `counter` key each time the homepage is accessed. If the key doesn't exist, Redis creates it and starts counting from 1.
3. **Display the Count**: The updated count is returned as an HTTP response each time the page is loaded.
