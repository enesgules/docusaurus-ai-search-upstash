### Introduction
In this quickstart tutorial, we will explore how to use Flask with Upstash Redis to build a simple web application that increments a counter each time a user accesses the homepage.
### Environment Setup
First, install Flask and the Upstash Redis client for Python.
```shell
pip install flask
pip install upstash-redis
```
### Database Setup
Create a Redis database using [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) or [Upstash CLI](https://github.com/upstash/cli) and export the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to your environment.
```shell
export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=<YOUR_URL>
export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
```
You can also use `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from your `.env` file.
### Application Setup
Create `app.py`:
```py app.py
from flask import Flask
from upstash_redis import Redis
app = Flask(__name__)
redis = Redis.from_env()
@app.route('/')
def index():
    count = redis.incr('counter')
    return f'Page visited {count} times.'
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
### Running the Application
Run the Flask app locally:
```shell
python app.py
```
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser, and you will see the `counter` increment with each refresh.
Code Breakdown
	1.	**Redis Setup:** We first import Flask and the Upstash Redis client. Using `Redis.from_env()`, we initialize the connection to our Redis database using the environment variables exported earlier.
	2.	**Increment Counter:** Each time the root route (`/`) is accessed, Redis increments the `counter` key. This key-value pair is automatically created in Redis if it does not exist, and its value is incremented on each request.
	3.	**Display the Count:** The number of visits is returned in the response as plain text.
