description: '"Tutorial on Using Upstash Redis In Your Phoenix App and Deploying it
  on Fly."'
title: "Elixir"
---
This tutorial showcases how one can use [fly.io](https://fly.io) to deploy a Phoenix
app using Upstash Redis to store results of external API calls.
See [code](https://github.com/upstash/examples/tree/master/examples/elixir-with-redis) and
[demo](https://elixir-redis.fly.dev/).
### `1` Create a Elixir app with Phoenix
To create an app, run the following command:
```
mix phx.new redix_demo --no-ecto
```
Phoenix apps are initialized with a datastore. We pass `--no-ecto` flag to disable
the datastore since we will only use Redis. See
[Phoenix documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html) for more details.
Navigate to the new directory by running
```
cd redix_demo
```
### `2` Add Redix
To connect to the Upstash Redis, we will use the
[Redix client](https://github.com/whatyouhide/redix.git) written for Elixir.
To add Redix to our project, we will first update the dependencies of our project. Simply
add the following two entries to the dependencies in the `mix.exs` file
(See [Redix documentation](https://github.com/whatyouhide/redix.git)):
```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:redix, "~> 1.1"},
    {:castore, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```
Then, run `mix deps.get` to install the new dependencies.
Next, we will add Redix to our app. In our case, we will add a single global Redix instance.
Open the `application.ex` file and find the `children` list in the `start` function.
First, add a method to read the connection parameters from the `REDIS_URL` environment variable.
We choose this name for the environment variable because Fly will create a secret with this name
when we launch the app with a Redis store. Use regex to extract the password, host and port
information from the Redis URL:
```elixir
  def start(_type, _args) do
    [_, password, host, port] = Regex.run(
      ~r{(.+):(.+)@(.+):(\d+)},
      System.get_env("REDIS_URL"),
      capture: :all_but_first
    )
    port = elem(Integer.parse(port), 0)
    # ...
  end
```
Next, add the Redix client to the project by adding it to the `children` array.
([See Redix Documentation for more details](https://hexdocs.pm/redix/real-world-usage.html#single-named-redix-instance))
```elixir
children = [
  # ...
  {
    Redix,
    name: :redix,
    host: host,
    port: port,
    password: password,
    socket_opts: [:inet6]
  }
]
```
Here, we would like to draw attention to the `socket_opts` parameter. If you wish to test
your app locally by creating an Upstash Redis yourself without Fly, you must define Redix
client **without the `socket_opts: [:inet6]` field**.
### `3` Testing the Connection
At this point, our app should now be able to communicate with Redix. To test if this
connection works as expected, we will first add a status page to our app.
To add this page, we will change the default landing page of our Phoenix app. Go to the
`lib/redix_demo_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex` file. Replace the content of
the file with:
```html
<.flash_group flash={@flash} />
<div class="container mx-auto px-4">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Redix Demo</h1>
  <form action="/" method="get" class="w-full flex items-center mb-4">
    <input type="text" name="text" placeholder="Location" class="flex-1 px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg shadow-sm focus:outline-none focus:border-blue-500">
    <button type="submit" class="ml-4 px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-600">Submit</button>
  </form>
  <%= if @text do %>
    <%= @text %>
  <% end %>
  <%= if @weather do %>
    <div class=" text-lg bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-4">
      <%= if @location do %>
        <strong>
          Location:
        </strong>
        <%= @location %>
      <% end %>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Weather:
        </strong>
        <%= @weather %> Â°C
      </p>
    </div>
  <% end %>
</div>
```
This HTML will show different content depending on the parameters we
pass it. It has a form at the top which is where the user will enter
some location. Below, we will show the weather information.
Next, open the `lib/redix_demo_web/router.ex` file. In this file,
URL paths are defined with the `scope` keyword. Update the scope
in the following way:
```
  scope "/", RedixDemoWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    get "/status", PageController, :status
    get "/", PageController, :home
    get "/:text", PageController, :home
  end
```
Our website will have a `/status` path, which will be rendered with the
`status` method we will define. The website will also render the home
page in `/` and in `/:text`. `/:text` will essentially match any route
and the route will be available to our app as a parameter when rendering.
Finally, we will define the status page in
`lib/redix_demo_web/controllers/page_controller.ex`. We will define a struct
`Payload` and a private method `render_home`. Then, we will define the home
page and the status page:
```elixir
defmodule RedixDemoWeb.PageController do
  use RedixDemoWeb, :controller
  defmodule Payload do
    defstruct text: nil, weather: nil, location: nil
  end
  def status(conn, _params) do
    case Redix.command(:redix, ["PING"]) do
      {:ok, response} ->
        render_home(conn, %Payload{text: "Redis Connection Status: Success! Response to 'PING': '#{response}'"})
      {:error, response} ->
        render_home(conn, %Payload{text: "Redis Connection Status: Error. Reason: #{response.reason}"})
      end
  end
  def home(conn, _params) do
    render_home(conn, %Payload{text: "Enter a location above to get the weather info!"})
  end
  defp render_home(conn, %Payload{} = payload) do
    render(conn, "home.html", text: payload.text, weather: payload.weather, location: payload.location)
  end
end
```
The home page simply renders our home page. The status page renders the same page, but
shows the response of a `PING` request to our Redis server.
We are now ready to deploy the app on Fly!
### `4` Deploy on Fly
To deploy the app on Fly, first
[install Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) and authenticate. Then,
launch the app with:
```
fly launch
```
If you haven't set `REDIS_URL` environment variable in your environment, `fly launch` command will show
an error when compiling the app but don't worry. You can still continue with launching the app.
Fly will add this environment variable itself.
Fly will at some point ask if we want to tweak the settings of the app. Choose yes (`y`):
```
>>> fly launch
Detected a Phoenix app
Creating app in /Users/examples/redix_demo
We're about to launch your Phoenix app on Fly.io. Here's what you're getting:
Organization: C. Arda                (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         redix_demo             (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Bucharest, Romania     (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                 (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                 (not requested)
Sentry:       false                  (not requested)
? Do you want to tweak these settings before proceeding? (y/N)
```
This will open the settings on the browser. Two settings are relevant to this guide:
- Region: Upstash is not available in all regions. Choose Amsterdam.
- Redis: Choose "Redis with Upstash"
If you already have a Redis on Fly you want to use, you may want to not choose the
"Redis with Upstash". Instead, you can get the `REDIS_URL` from [the Upstash Fly console](https://console.upstash.com/flyio/redis)
and add it as a secret with `fly secrets set REDIS_URL=****`. Note that the `REDIS_URL`
will be in `redis://default:****@fly-****.upstash.io:****` format.
Once the app is launched, deploy it with:
```
fly deploy
```
The website will become avaiable after some time. Check the `/status` page to see that
the redis connection is correctly done.
In the rest of our tutorial, we will work on caching the responses from an external api.
If you are only interested in how a Phoenix app with Redis can be deployed on Fly, you
may not need to read the rest of the tutorial.
### `5` Using Redix to Cache External API Responses
Finally, we will now build our website to offer weather information. We will use the API
of [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to get the weather information upon user
request. We will cache the results of our calls in Upstash Redis to reduce the number
of calls we make to the external API and to reduce the response time of our app.
In the end, we will have a method `def home(conn, %{"text" => text})` in the
`lib/redix_demo_web/controllers/page_controller.ex` file. To see the final file, find the
[`page_controller.ex` file Upstash examples repository](https://github.com/upstash/examples/blob/main/examples/elixir-with-redis/lib/redix_demo_web/controllers/page_controller.ex).
First, we need to define some private methods to handle the request logic. We start off
with a function to fetch the weather. The method gets the location string and replaces
the empty characters with `%20`. Then it calls `fetch_weather_from_cache` method we will
define. Depending on the result, it either returns the result from cache, or fetches the
result from the api.
```elixir
  defp fetch_weather(location) do
    location = String.replace(location, " ", "%20")
    case fetch_weather_from_cache(location) do
      {:ok, cached_weather} ->
        {:ok, cached_weather}
      {:error, :not_found} ->
        fetch_weather_from_api(location)
      {:error, reason} ->
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end
```
Now, we will define the `fetch_weather_from_cache` method. This method will use
Redix to fetch the weather from the location. If it's not found, we will return
`{:error, :not_found}`. If it's found, we will return after decoding it into a
map.
```elixir
  defp fetch_weather_from_cache(location) do
    case Redix.command(:redix, ["GET", "weather:#{location}"]) do
      {:ok, nil} ->
        {:error, :not_found}
      {:ok, cached_weather_json} ->
        {:ok, Jason.decode!(cached_weather_json)}
      {:error, _reason} ->
        {:error, "Failed to fetch weather data from cache."}
    end
  end
```
Next, we will define the `fetch_weather_from_api` method. This method
requests the weather information from the external API. If the request
is successfull, it also saves the result in the cache with the
`cache_weather_response` method.
```elixir
  defp fetch_weather_from_api(location) do
    weather_api_key = System.get_env("WEATHER_API_KEY")
    url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=#{weather_api_key}&q=#{location}&aqi=no"
    case HTTPoison.get(url) do
      {:ok, %{status_code: 200, body: body}} ->
        weather_info = body
                      |> Jason.decode!()
                      |> get_weather_info()
        # Cache the weather response in Redis for 8 hours
        cache_weather_response(location, Jason.encode!(weather_info))
        {:ok, weather_info}
      {:ok, %{status_code: status_code, body: body}} ->
        {:error, "#{body} (#{status_code})"}
      {:error, _reason} ->
        {:error, "Failed to fetch weather data."}
    end
  end
```
In the `cache_weather_response` method, we simply store the weather
information in our Redis:
```elixir
  defp cache_weather_response(location, weather_data) do
    case Redix.command(:redix, ["SET", "weather:#{location}", weather_data, "EX", 8 * 60 * 60]) do
      {:ok, _} ->
        :ok
      {:error, _reason} ->
        {:error, "Failed to cache weather data."}
    end
  end
```
Finally, we define the `get_weather_info` and `home` methods.
```elixir
  def home(conn, %{"text" => text}) do
    case fetch_weather(text) do
      {:ok, %{"location" => location, "temp" => temp_c, "condition" => condition_text}} ->
        render_home(conn, %Payload{weather: "#{condition_text}, #{temp_c}", location: location})
      {:error, reason} ->
        render_home(conn, %Payload{text: reason})
    end
  end
  defp get_weather_info(%{
    "location" => %{
      "name" => name,
      "region" => region
    },
    "current" => %{
      "temp_c" => temp_c,
      "condition" => %{
        "text" => condition_text
      }
    }
  }) do
    %{"location" => "#{name}, #{region}", "temp" => temp_c, "condition" => condition_text}
  end
```
### `6` Re-deploying the App
To deploy the app after adding the home page logic, only a few steps remain to deploy the
finished app.
First, add `{:httpoison, "~> 1.5"}` dependency to `mix.exs` file and run `mix deps.get`.
Then, get an API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and set it as secret in
fly with:
```
fly secrets set WEATHER_API_KEY=****
```
Now, you can run `fly deploy` in your directory to deploy the completed app!
