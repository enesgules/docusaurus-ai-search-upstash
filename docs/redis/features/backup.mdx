You can create a manual backup of your database and restore that backup to any of your databases. Both backup and restore operations require that your database is in one of the AWS regions.
Additionally, you can utilize the daily backup feature to automatically create backups of your database on a daily basis.
### Create A Manual Backup
To create a manual backup of your database:
- Go to the database details page and navigate to the `Backups` tab
- Click on the `Backup` button and fill in a name for your backup. **Your backup name must be unique.**
- Then click on the `Create` button.
During the process of creating a backup for your database, it is important to note that your database will be temporarily locked, which means these operations will be unavailable during this time:
