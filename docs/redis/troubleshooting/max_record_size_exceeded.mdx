title: "ERR max single record size exceeded"
---
### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR max single record size exceeded
```
### Diagnosis
An entry size exceeds the max record size limit which is `100Mb` for "Free" and
"Pay as you go" databases. You may reach this limit either by inserting a single
huge value or appending many small values to an entry. This entry can be a
String, List, Set, Hash etc. Read (`GET`, `LRANGE`, `HMGET`, `ZRANGE` etc) and
delete (`DEL`, `LPOP`, `HDEL`, `SREM` etc) requests will not be affected.
### Solution-1
You can split your data into smaller chunks and store them as separate entries
with different keys.
### Solution-2
You can upgrade your database to Pro as it has higher limits. Also
you can submit quota increase request in the console or contact
support@upstash.com about the options with higher max record size limit.
