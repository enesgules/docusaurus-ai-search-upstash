title: "Error read ECONNRESET"
---
### Symptom
The client can not connect to the database throwing an exception similar to:
```
[ioredis] Unhandled error event: Error: read ECONNRESET
    at TCP.onStreamRead (node:internal/stream_base_commons:211:20)
```
### Diagnosis
The server is TLS enabled but your connection (client) is not.
### Solution
Check your connection parameters and ensure you enable TLS.
If you are using a Redis URL then it should start with `rediss://`.
You can copy the correct client configuration from Upstash console clicking on
**Redis Connect** button.
