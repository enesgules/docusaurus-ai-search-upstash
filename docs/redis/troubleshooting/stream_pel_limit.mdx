title: "ERR XReadGroup is cancelled"
---
### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR XReadGroup is cancelled. Pending Entries List limit per consumer is about to be reached. Limit: 1000, Current PEL size: 90, Requested Read: 20, Key: mstream, Group: group1, Consumer: consumer1.
```
### Diagnosis
Pending Entries List of the stream for the consumer is full. For each consumer
in a consumer group, there is a pending entries list. This list keeps the
messages that are delivered to a consumer but not yet acknowledged via
[XACK](https://redis.io/commands/xack/). This list is populated via
[XREADGROUP](https://redis.io/commands/xreadgroup/).
### Solution
Acknowledge the consumed messages via [XACK](https://redis.io/commands/xack/)
from the list of the associated group and consumer.
