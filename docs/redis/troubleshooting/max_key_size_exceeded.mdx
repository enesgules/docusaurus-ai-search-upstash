title: "ERR max key size exceeded"
---
### Symptom
The client gets an exception similar to:
```
ReplyError: ERR max key size exceeded. Limit: X bytes, Actual: Z bytes
```
### Diagnosis
Size of the key in the request exceeds the max key size limit, which is `32Kb`.
### Solution
This is a hardcoded limit and cannot be configured per database. You should
reduce the key size.
