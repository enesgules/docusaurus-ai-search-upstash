title: "WRONGPASS invalid or missing auth token"
---
### Symptom
The database rejects your request with an error similar to:
```
UpstashError: WRONGPASS invalid or missing auth token
```
### Diagnosis
The server rejects your request because the auth token is missing or invalid.
Most likely you have forgotten to set it in your environment variables, or you
are using a wrong token.
The connection password can only be used in traditional Redis clients. If you
want to connect over HTTP, you need to use the HTTP auth token.
### Solution
1. Check that you have set the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` in your environment
   variables and it is loaded correctly by your application at runtime.
2. Make sure you are using the correct HTTP auth token. You can copy the correct
   client configuration from the
   [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/redis) by copying the snippet
   from the `Connect to your database` -> `@upstash/redis` tab

Or scroll further down to the `REST API` section and copy the
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from there.
