title: "Nuxt with Redis"
---
This tutorial uses Redis as state store for a Nuxt application. In it, we will build an application
which simply increments a counter and saves & fetches the last increment time.
See [code](https://github.com/upstash/examples/tree/master/examples/nuxt-with-redis) and
[demo](https://nuxt-with-redis.vercel.app)
### `1` Create Nuxt.js Project
Run this in terminal
```bash
npx nuxi@latest init nuxtjs-with-redis
```
Go to the new directory `nuxtjs-with-redis` and install `@upstash/redis`:
```
npm install @upstash/redis
```
### `2` Create a Upstash Redis database
Next, you will need an Upstash Redis database. You can follow
[our guide for creating a new database](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted).
### `3` Set up environment variables
Copy the `.env.example` file in this directory to `.env`
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, set the following environment variables:
```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=""
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=""
```
You can get the values of these env variables on the page of your Redis database.
### `4` Define the endpoint
Next, we will define the endpoint which will call Redis:
```javascript title="server/api/increment.ts"
import { defineEventHandler } from "h3";
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
// Initialize Redis
const redis = new Redis({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL || "",
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN || ""
});
export default defineEventHandler(async () => {
  const identifier = "api_call_counter";
  try {
    // Increment the API call counter and get the updated value
    const count = await redis.incr(identifier);
    // Optionally, you can also retrieve other information like the last time it was called
    const lastCalled = await redis.get("last_called");
    const lastCalledAt = lastCalled || "Never";
    // Store the current timestamp as the last called time
    await redis.set("last_called", new Date().toISOString());
    // Return the count and last called time
    return {
      success: true,
      count: count,
      lastCalled: lastCalledAt,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Redis error:", error);
    return {
      success: false,
      message: "Error interacting with Redis",
    };
  }
});
```
### `5` Run
Finally, we can run the application and call our endpoint:
```bash
npm run dev
```
If you are using [our example app](https://github.com/upstash/examples/tree/master/examples/nuxt-with-redis),
you can simply click the `Increment` button to run the endpoint we defined.
Otherwise, you can simply make a curl request:
```
curl http://localhost:3000/api/increment
```
When you make the request, you should see something like this:
```
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 166,
  "lastCalled": "2024-10-10T07:04:42.381Z"
}
```
### Notes:
- For best performance the application should run in the same region with the
  Redis database's region.
