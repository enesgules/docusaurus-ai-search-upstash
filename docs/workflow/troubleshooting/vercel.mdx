# Common Issues and Solutions
### Preview Deployment Protection
**Problem:**
When Deployment Protection setting is enabled on Vercel, it's not possible to trigger and complete a workflow run on a preview deployment.
**Solution:**
Vercel provides a way to bypass this protection by using a bypass secret. To create one, follow these steps:
Now that you have a bypass token, you can add it to your workflow URL as a query parameter.
Imagine that you have a Vercel Preview and there is a workflow endpoint at `https://vercel-preview.com/workflow`.
You can call the workflow like this in preview:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://vercel-preview.com/workflow?x-vercel-protection-bypass=<PROTECTION_BYPASS_SECRET>' \
  -d 'Hello world!'
```
