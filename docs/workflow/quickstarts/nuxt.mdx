This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy Upstash Workflow with Nuxt.js. You can also explore our [Nuxt example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/nuxt) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.
## Prerequisites
1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (another package manager) installed.
If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.
## Step 1: Installation
First, install the Workflow SDK in your Nuxt project:
## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This token is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.
```bash Terminal
touch .env.local
```
Open the environment file and add your QStash token:
```bash .env.local
QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
```
Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:
## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint
A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.
To define a workflow endpoint in a Nuxt.js project, navigate into the Nuxt.js `server/api` directory and create a new file, for example called `workflow.ts`. This file will contain your workflow:
```typescript server/api/workflow.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/h3"
const { handler } = serve(
  async (context) => {
    await context.run("initial-step", () => {
      console.log("initial step ran")
    })
    await context.run("second-step", () => {
      console.log("second step ran")
    })
  },
)
export default handler;
```
## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint
Upstash Workflow is powered by [QStash](/qstash/overall/getstarted), and QStash needs a publicly accessible URL to run your workflows. Here's how to [set up your workflow endpoint for local development](/workflow/howto/local-development).
Once you have a live URL, proceeed with either one of the following steps:
### Setting an enviroment variable (recommended)
Set your publically accessible URL as an environment variable. This variable is only needed for local development and doesn't need to be set in production:
```bash .env.local
UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL=https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/
```
### Using the `baseUrl` option
As an alternative to setting an environment variable, you can also use the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` method. This option is only needed for local development and can be omitted in production:
```typescript server/api/workflow.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/h3"
const { handler } = serve(
  async (context) => { ... },
  {
    // no /api/workflow, just the base URL
    baseUrl: "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/",
  }
)
export default handler;
```
### Triggering the workflow
After setting your live URL as the environment variable or `baseUrl` option, trigger your workflow by first starting your Nuxt app:
```bash Terminal
npm run dev
```
and then making a POST request to your workflow endpoint. For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:
```bash Terminal
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/api/workflow
# result: {"workflowRunId":"wfr_xxxxxx"}
```
See the [documentation on starting a workflow](/workflow/howto/start) for other ways you can start your workflow.
Use this ID to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.
## Step 5: Deploying to Production
When deploying your Nuxt.js application with Upstash Workflow to production, there are a few key points to keep in mind:
1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that all necessary environment variables are set in your platforms project settings. For example, your `QSTASH_TOKEN` and any other configuration variables your workflow might need.
2. **Remove Local Development Settings**: In your production code, you can remove or conditionally exclude any local development settings. For example, the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` function can be omitted in production:
   ```typescript server/api/workflow.ts
   const { handler } = serve(
     async (context) => {
       // Your workflow steps
     },
     {
       // Conditionally set in development, but not in production
       // as the baseUrl is automatically set in production
       baseUrl:
         process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
           ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
           : undefined,
     }
   )
   export default handler;
   ```
3. **Deployment**: Deploy your Nuxt application to Vercel, Cloudflare Pages or other platforms as you normally would. These platforms will automatically detect and build your Nuxt application.
4. **Verify Workflow Endpoint**: After deployment, verify that your workflow endpoint is accessible by making a POST request to your production URL:
   ```bash Terminal
   curl -X POST https://<YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL>/api/workflow
   ```
5. **Monitor in QStash Dashboard**: Use the QStash dashboard to monitor your production workflows. You can track workflow runs, view step statuses, and access detailed logs.
6. **Set Up Alerts**: Consider setting up alerts in Sentry or other monitoring tools to be notified of any workflow failures in production.
