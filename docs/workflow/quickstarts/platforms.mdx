## Using Workflow with another platform
If you'd like to use Upstash Workflow for a platform not listed above, you can do so using the base `serve` method:
```javascript
import { serve } from '@upstash/workflow'
```
and adjust this method for your platform. For details, see [our platform-specific method implementations](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/platforms).
