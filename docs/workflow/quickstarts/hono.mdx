This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to use and deploy Upstash Workflow with Hono. You can also explore our [Hono example](https://github.com/upstash/workflow-js/tree/main/examples/hono) for a detailed, end-to-end example and best practices.
## Prerequisites
1. An Upstash QStash API key.
2. Node.js and npm (another package manager) installed.
If you haven't obtained your QStash API key yet, you can do so by [signing up](https://console.upstash.com/login) for an Upstash account and navigating to your QStash dashboard.
## Step 1: Installation
First, install the Workflow SDK in your Hono project:
## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root and add your QStash token. This key is used to authenticate your application with the QStash service.
```bash Terminal
touch .dev.vars
```
Open the environment file and add your QStash token, as well as the environment you're running in:
```bash .dev.vars
QSTASH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx
ENVIRONMENT=development
```
Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual QStash token found here:
## Step 3: Create a Workflow Endpoint
A workflow endpoint allows you to define a set of steps that, together, make up a workflow. Each step contains a piece of business logic that is automatically retried on failure, with easy monitoring via our visual workflow dashboard.
To define a workflow endpoint with Hono, navigate into your entrypoint file (usually `src/index.ts`) and add the following code:
## Step 4: Run the Workflow Endpoint
To start your Hono app locally, run the following command:
```bash Terminal
npm run dev
```
Executing this command prints a local URL to your workflow endpoint. By default, this URL is `http://localhost:8787`.
You can verify your correct environment variable setup by checking the wrangler output, which should now have access to your `QSTASH_TOKEN` binding and log your local URL:
Upstash Workflow is powered by [QStash](/qstash/overall/getstarted), and QStash needs a publicly accessible URL to run your workflows. You can easily forward your localhost URL to a live URL by following our guide about [setting up your workflow endpoint for local development](/workflow/howto/local-development).
Once you have a live URL, proceeed with either one of the following steps:
### Setting an enviroment variable (recommended)
Set your publically accessible URL (without extensions such as `/workflow`) as an environment variable. This variable is only needed for local development and doesn't need to be set in production:
```bash .dev.vars
UPSTASH_WORKFLOW_URL=https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/
```
### Using the `baseUrl` option
As an alternative to setting an environment variable, you can also use the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` method. This option is only needed for local development and can be omitted in production:
```typescript src/index.ts
import { Hono } from "hono"
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/hono"
const app = new Hono()
app.post("/workflow",
  serve(async (context) => { ... }, {
    // just the base URL, no `/workflow`
    baseUrl: 'https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/'
  })
)
export default app
```
### Triggering the workflow
After setting your live URL as the environment variable or `baseUrl` option, trigger your workflow by sending a POST request. For each workflow run, a unique workflow run ID is returned:
```bash Terminal
curl -X POST https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/workflow'
# result: {"workflowRunId":"wfr_xxxxxx"}
```
See the [documentation on starting a workflow](/workflow/howto/start) for other ways you can start your workflow.
Use this ID to track the workflow run and see its status in your QStash workflow dashboard. All steps are listed with their statuses, headers, and body for a detailed overview of your workflow from start to finish. Click on a step to see its detailed logs.
## Step 5: Deploying to Production
When deploying your Hono app with Upstash Workflow to production, there are a few key points to keep in mind:
1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that all necessary environment variables from your `.dev.vars` file are set in your Cloudflare Worker project settings. For example, your `QSTASH_TOKEN`, and any other configuration variables your workflow might need.
2. **Remove Local Development Settings**: In your production code, you can remove or conditionally exclude any local development settings. For example, the `baseUrl` option in the `serve` function can be omitted in production.
```typescript src/index.ts
import { Hono } from "hono"
import { serve, WorkflowBindings } from "@upstash/workflow/hono"
import { env } from "hono/adapter"
interface Bindings extends WorkflowBindings {
  ENVIRONMENT: "development" | "production"
}
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>()
app.post("/workflow", (c) => {
  const { ENVIRONMENT } = env(c)
  const handler = serve<unknown, Bindings>(
    async (context) => { ... },
    {
      // baseUrl is not necessary in production
      baseUrl: ENVIRONMENT === "development"
        ? "https://<YOUR_NGROK_OR_TUNNEL_URL>/"
        : undefined,
    }
  )
  return await handler(c)
})
export default app
```
3. **Deployment**: Deploy your Hono app to production as you normally would, for example using the Cloudflare CLI:
   ```bash Terminal
   wrangler deploy
   ```
4. **Verify Workflow Endpoint**: After deployment, verify that your workflow endpoint is accessible by making a POST request to your production URL:
   ```bash Terminal
   curl -X POST https://<YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL>/workflow
   ```
5. **Monitor in QStash Dashboard**: Use the QStash dashboard to monitor your production workflows. You can track workflow runs, view step statuses, and access detailed logs.
6. **Set Up Alerts**: Consider setting up alerts in Sentry or other monitoring tools to be notified of any workflow failures in production.
