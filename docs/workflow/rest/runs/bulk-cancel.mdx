title: "Bulk Cancel Workflows"
---
Bulk cancel allows you to cancel multiple workflow runs at once.
This operation scans all your workflow runs and attempts to cancel them.
If a specific workflow run cannot be canceled, it will return an error message.
Therefore, some workflow runs may not be cancelled at the end.
In such cases, you can run the bulk cancel operation multiple times.
## Request
## Response
A cancelled object with the number of cancelled workflow runs.
```JSON
{
  "cancelled": number
}
```
