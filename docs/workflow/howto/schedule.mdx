title: "Schedule repeated runs"

You can schedule a workflow to run periodically using a cron definition.
## Scheduling a workflow
For example, let's define a workflow that creates a backup of some important data daily. Our workflow endpoint might look like this:
```typescript api/workflow/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { createBackup, uploadBackup } from "./utils";
export const { POST } = serve(
  async (ctx) => {
    const backup = await ctx.run("create-backup", async () => {
      return await createBackup();
    });
    await ctx.run("upload-backup", async () => {
      await uploadBackup(backup);
    });
  },
  {
    failureFunction({ context, failStatus, failResponse, failHeader }) {
      // immediately get notified for failed backups
      // i.e. send an email, log to Sentry
    },
  }
);
```
To run this endpoint on a schedule, navigate to `Schedules` in your QStash dashboard and click `Create Schedule`:
Enter your live endpoint URL, add a CRON expression to define the interval at which your endpoint is called (i.e. every day, every 15 minutes, ...) and click `Schedule`:
Your workflow will now run repeatedly at the interval you have defined. For more details on CRON expressions, see our [QStash scheduling documentation](/qstash/features/schedules).
## Scheduling a per-user workflow
In order to massively improve the user experience, many applications send weekly summary reports to their users. These could be weekly analytics summaries or SEO statistics to keep users engaged with the platform.
Let's create a user-specific schedule, sending a first report to each user exactly 7 days after they signed up:
```typescript api/sign-up/route.ts
import { signUp } from "@/utils/auth-utils";
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";
const client = new Client({ token: process.env.QSTASH_TOKEN! });
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const userData: UserData = await request.json();
  // Simulate user registration
  const user = await signUp(userData);
  // Calculate the date for the first summary (7 days from now)
  const firstSummaryDate = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  // Create cron expression for weekly summaries starting 7 days from signup
  const cron = `${firstSummaryDate.getMinutes()} ${firstSummaryDate.getHours()} * * ${firstSummaryDate.getDay()}`;
  // Schedule weekly account summary
  await client.schedules.create({
    scheduleId: `user-summary-${user.email}`,
    destination: "https://<YOUR_APP_URL>/api/send-weekly-summary",
    body: { userId: user.id },
    cron: cron,
  });
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: true, message: "User registered and summary scheduled" },
    { status: 201 }
  );
}
```
This code will call our workflow every week, starting exactly seven days after a user signs up. Each call to our workflow will contain the respective user's ID.
Note: when creating a user-specific schedule, pass a unique `scheduleId` to ensure the operation is idempotent. (See [caveats](/workflow/basics/caveats) for more details on why this is important).
Lastly, add the summary-creating and email-sending logic inside of your workflow. For example:
```typescript api/send-weekly-summary/route.ts
import { serve } from "@upstash/workflow/nextjs";
import { getUserData, generateSummary } from "@/utils/user-utils";
import { sendEmail } from "@/utils/email-utils";
// Type-safety for starting our workflow
interface WeeklySummaryData {
  userId: string;
}
export const { POST } = serve<WeeklySummaryData>(async (context) => {
  const { userId } = context.requestPayload;
  // Step 1: Fetch user data
  const user = await context.run("fetch-user-data", async () => {
    return await getUserData(userId);
  });
  // Step 2: Generate weekly summary
  const summary = await context.run("generate-summary", async () => {
    return await generateSummary(userId);
  });
  // Step 3: Send email with weekly summary
  await context.run("send-summary-email", async () => {
    await sendEmail(user.email, "Your Weekly Summary", summary);
  });
});
```
Just like that, each user will receive an account summary every week, starting one week after signing up.
