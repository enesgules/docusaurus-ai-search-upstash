title: "Cancel a run"
---
You can cancel a running workflow both programatically and from your Upstash Workflow console.
## Cancelling via console
In your Upstash Workflow console, find the run you'd like to cancel and press the `Cancel Workflow` button on the right side:
## Cancelling programatically
```javascript
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" })
await client.cancel({ ids: "<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>" })
```
And replace `<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>` with your actual run ID. See [the documentation of `client.cancel` method for more information about other ways of canceling workflows](/workflow/basics/client#cancel-workflow).
You can also use the [Upstash Workflow REST API](/workflow/rest/runs/cancel) to cancel a run programatically.
