title: "Start a Run"
---
You’ve defined your workflow, and the final step is to trigger the endpoint!
There are three main ways to start your workflow:
### 1. [Using `client.trigger` (Recommended)](/workflow/basics/client#trigger-workflow)
We recommend using `client.trigger` to start your workflow as it returns the workflow run ID in its result and results in one less QStash publish per workflow.
```ts
// Using the workflow client
import { Client } from "@upstash/workflow";
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const { workflowRunId } = await client.trigger({
  url: "https://workflow-endpoint.com",
  body: "hello there!",         // Optional body
  headers: { ... },             // Optional headers
  workflowRunId: "my-workflow", // Optional workflow run ID
  retries: 3                    // Optional retries for the initial request
});
```
### 2. [Publishing a message with QStash](/qstash/howto/publishing)
```ts
// Using the QStash client
import { Client } from "@upstash/qstash";
const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });
const { messageId } = await client.publishJSON({
  url: "https://workflow-endpoint.com",
  body: { hello: "there!" },
  headers: { ... },
  retries: 3
});
```
### 3. Sending an HTTP Request
### Secured Endpoints
If you’ve [secured your endpoint with signing keys](/workflow/howto/security), only the first two methods (`trigger` and `publish`) will work. Direct calls to the endpoint (e.g., via `curl` or `fetch`) will not be accepted.
### Accessing Payload and Headers
When you call the endpoint, the payload and headers you send will be accessible in the context:
- The payload is available in the `context.requestPayload` field.
- The headers are available in the `context.headers` field.
For more details, refer to the documentation on [the Context object](/workflow/basics/context).
