title: "Metadata Filtering"
---
You can further limit the vector similarity search by providing a filter based on a specific metadata criteria.
Queries with metadata filters only return vectors which have metadata matching with the filter.
Upstash Vector allows you to filter keys which have the following value types:
- string
- number
- boolean
- object
- array
Filtering is implemented as a combination of in and post-filtering. Every query is assigned a filtering budget,
determining the number of candidate vectors that can be compared against the filter during query execution. If this
budget is exceeded, the system fallbacks into post-filtering. Therefore, with highly selective filters, fewer
than `topK` vectors may be returned.
## Filter Syntax
A filter has a syntax that resembles SQL, which consists of operators on object keys and boolean operators
to combine them.
Assuming you have a metadata like below:
```json
{
    "city": "Istanbul",
    "country": "Turkey",
    "is_capital": false,
    "population": 15460000,
    "geography": {
        "continent": "Asia",
        "coordinates": {
            "latitude": 41.0082,
            "longitude": 28.9784
        }
    },
    "economy": {
        "currency": "TRY",
        "major_industries": [
            "Tourism",
            "Textiles",
            "Finance"
        ]
    }
}
```
Then, you can query similar vectors with a filter like below:
### Operators
#### Equals (=)
The `equals` operator filters keys whose value is equal to given literal.
It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.
```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population = 15460000 AND is_capital = false
```
#### Not Equals (!=)
The `not equals` operator filters keys whose value is not equal to given literal.
It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.
```SQL
country != 'Germany' AND population != 12500000 AND is_capital != true
```
#### Less Than (\<)
The `less than` operator filters keys whose value is less than the given literal.
It is applicable to _number_ values.
```SQL
population < 20000000 OR geography.coordinates.longitude < 30.0
```
#### Less Than or Equals (\<=)
The `less than or equals` operator filters keys whose value is less than or equal to the given literal.
It is applicable to _number_ values.
```SQL
population <= 20000000 OR geography.coordinates.longitude <= 30.0
```
#### Greater Than (>)
The `greater than` operator filters keys whose value is greater than the given literal.
It is applicable to _number_ values.
```SQL
population > 10000000 OR geography.coordinates.latitude > 39.5
```
#### Greater Than or Equals (>=)
The `greater than or equals` operator filters keys whose value is greater than or equal to the given literal.
It is applicable to _number_ values.
```SQL
population >= 10000000 OR geography.coordinates.latitude >= 39.5
```
#### Glob
The `glob` operator filters keys whose value matches the given UNIX glob pattern.
It is applicable to _string_ values.
It is a case sensitive operator.
The glob operator supports the following wildcards:
- `*` matches zero or more characters.
- `?` matches exactly one character.
- `[]` matches one character from the list
    - `[abc]` matches either `a`, `b`, or `c`.
    - `[a-z]` matches one of the range of characters from `a` to `z`.
    - `[^abc]` matches any one character other than `a`, `b`, or `c`.
    - `[^a-z]` matches any one character other than `a` to `z`.
For example, the filter below would only match with city names whose second character is `s` or `z`,
and ends with anything other than `m` to `z`.
```SQL
city GLOB '?[sz]*[^m-z]'
```
#### Not Glob
The `not glob` operator filters keys whose value does not match the given UNIX glob pattern.
It is applicable to _string_ values.
It has the same properties with the glob operator.
For example, the filter below would only match with city names whose first character is anything other than `A`.
```SQL
city NOT GLOB 'A*'
```
#### In
The `in` operator filters keys whose value is equal to any of the given literals.
It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.
```SQL
country IN ('Germany', 'Turkey', 'France')
```
Semantically, it is equivalent to equals operator applied to all of the given literals with `OR` boolean operator in between:
```SQL
country = 'Germany' OR country = 'Turkey' OR country = 'France'
```
#### Not In
The `not in` operator filters keys whose value is not equal to any of the given literals.
It is applicable to _string_, _number_, and _boolean_ values.
```SQL
economy.currency NOT IN ('USD', 'EUR')
```
Semantically, it is equivalent to not equals operator applied to all of the given literals with `AND` boolean operator in between:
```SQL
economy.currency != 'USD' AND economy.currency != 'EUR'
```
#### Contains
The `contains` operator filters keys whose value contains the given literal.
It is applicable to `array` values.
```SQL
economy.major_industries CONTAINS 'Tourism'
```
#### Not Contains
The `not contains` operator filters keys whose value does not contain the given literal.
It is applicable to `array` values.
```SQL
economy.major_industries NOT CONTAINS 'Steel Production'
```
#### Has Field
The `has field` operator filters keys which having the given JSON field.
```SQL
HAS FIELD geography.coordinates
```
#### Has Not Field
The `has not field` operator filters keys which not having the given JSON field.
```SQL
HAS NOT FIELD geography.coordinates.longitude
```
### Boolean Operators
Operators above can be combined with `AND` and `OR` boolean operators to form
compound filters.
```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000
```
Boolean operators can be grouped with parentheses to have higher precendence.
```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND (population > 10000000 OR is_capital = false)
```
When no parentheses are provided in ambigous filters, `AND` will have higher
precendence than `OR`. So, the filter
```SQL
country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000 OR is_capital = false
```
would be equivalent to
```SQL
(country = 'Turkey' AND population > 10000000) OR is_capital = false
```
### Filtering Nested Objects
It is possible to filter nested object keys by referencing them with the `.` accessor.
Nested objects can be at arbitrary depths, so more than one `.` accessor can be used
in the same identifier.
```SQL
economy.currency != 'USD' AND geography.coordinates.latitude >= 35.0
```
### Filtering Array Elements
Apart from the `CONTAINS` and `NOT CONTAINS` operators, individual array elements can also
be filtered by referencing them with the `[]` accessor by their indexes.
Indexing is zero based.
```SQL
economy.major_industries[0] = 'Tourism'
```
Also, it is possible to index from the back using the `#` character with negative values.
`#` can be thought as the number of elements in the array, so `[#-1]` would reference the
last character.
```SQL
economy.major_industries[#-1] = 'Finance'
```
### Miscellaneous
- Identifiers (the left side of the operators) should be of the form `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9.[\]#-]*`. In simpler terms, they should
start with characters from the English alphabet or `_`, and can continue with same characters plus numbers and other accessors
like `.`, `[0]`, or `[#-1]`.
- The string literals (strings in the right side of the operators) can be either single or double quoted.
- Boolean literals are represented as `1` or `0`.
- The operators, boolean operators, and boolean literals are case insensitive.
