title: "Sparse Indexes"
---
Sparse vectors are representations in a high-dimensional space,
where only a small number of dimensions have non-zero values.
For example, for the same text, a dense vector representation with
the BGE-M3 model would have 1024 non-zero valued dimensions.
However, the sparse vector representation of the same text would
have less than a hundred non-zero valued dimensions, whereas vector
space potentially has more than 250 thousand dimensions. Also, unlike
dense vector representations, sparse vectors might have varying
non-zero valued dimensions depending on the text.
Generally, sparse vectors can be represented with two arrays of equal
sizes:
- The first array for the indices contains the indices of the non-zero
  dimensions.
- The second array for values contains the floating point values for
  the non-zero dimensions.
```python
dense = [0.1, 0.3, , ...thousands of non-zero values..., 0.5, 0.2]
sparse = (
    [23, 42, 5523, 123987, 240001], # some low number of dimension indices
    [0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5], # non-zero values corresponding to dimensions
)
```
Unlike dense vectors which excel at approximate semantic matching,
sparse vectors are particularly useful for tasks that require exact or
near exact matching of tokens/words/features. That makes it useful
for various tasks, such as:
- **Information Retrieval and Text Analysis**: By representing documents
  as sparse vectors where each token/word would correspond to a dimension
  in high dimensional vocabulary; and varying values by the frequencies
  of the tokens/words in the document or by weighting them with inverse
  document frequencies to favor rare terms, you can build complex
  search pipelines.
- **Recommender Systems**: By representing user interactions, preferences,
  ratings, or purchases as sparse vectors, you can identify relevant
  recommendations, and personalize content delivery.
## Creating Sparse Vectors
There are various ways to create sparse vectors. You can use
[BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) for information
retrieval tasks, or use models like [SPLADE](https://github.com/naver/splade)
that enhance documents and queries with term weighting and expansion.
Upstash gives you full control by allowing you to upsert and query
sparse vectors.
Also, to make embedding easier for you, Upstash provides some hosted
models and allows you to upsert and query text data. Behind the scenes,
the text data is converted to sparse vectors.
You can create your index with a sparse embedding model to use this feature.
### BGE-M3 Sparse Vectors
BGE-M3 is a multi-functional, multi-lingual, and multi-granular model
widely used for dense indexes.
We also provide BGE-M3 as a sparse vector embedder, which outputs
sparse vectors from `250_002` dimensional space.
These sparse vectors have values where each token is weighted
according to the input text, which enhances traditional sparse vectors
with contextuality.
### BM25 Sparse Vectors
BM25 is a popular algorithm used in full-text search systems to rank
documents based on their relevance to a query.
This algorithm relies on key principles of term frequency,
inverse document frequency, and document length normalization,
making it well-suited for text retrieval tasks.
- **Rare terms are important**: BM25 gives more weight to words that are
  less common in the collection of documents. For example, in a search
  for “Upstash Vector”, the word “Upstash” might be considered more
  important than “Vector” if it appears less frequently across all documents.
- **Repeating a Word Helps—But Only Up to a Point**: BM25 considers how
  often a word appears in a document, but it limits the benefit of repeating
  the word too many times. This means mentioning “Upstash” a hundred times
  won’t make a document overly important compared to one that mentions
  it just a few times.
- **Shorter Documents Often Rank Higher**: Shorter documents that match
  the query are usually more relevant. BM25 adjusts for document length
  so longer documents don’t get unfairly ranked just because they contain
  more words.
Upstash provides a general purpose BM25 algorithm, that applies to documents
and queries in English. It tokenizes the text into words, removes stop words,
stems the remaining words, and assigns a weighted value to them, based on the
BM25 formula:
```
                       IDF(qᵢ) * f(qᵢ, D) * (k₁ + 1)
BM25(D, Q) = Σ ----------------------------------------------
               f(qᵢ, D) + k₁ * (1 - b + b * (|D| / avg(|D|)))
```
Where:
- `f(qᵢ, D)` is the frequency of term `qᵢ` in document `D`.
- `|D|` is the length of document `D`.
- `avg(|D|)` is the average document length in the collection.
- `k₁` is the term frequency saturation parameter.
- `b` is the length normalization parameter.
- `IDF(qᵢ)` is the inverse document frequency of term `qᵢ`
To make it a general purpose model, we had to decide on some of the
constants mentioned above, which would differ from implementation
to implementation. We decided to use the following values for
- `k₁` = `1.2`, a widely used value in the absence of advanced optimizations
- `b` = `0.75`, a widely used value in the absence of advanced optimizations
- `avg(|D|)` = `32`, which was chosen by tokenizing and taking the average of
  [MSMARCO](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) dataset vectors, rounded
  to the nearest power of two.
In the future, we might provide support for more languages and the ability to
provide different values for the above constants.
As for the inverse document frequency `IDF(qᵢ)`, we maintain that information
per token in the vector database itself. You can use it by providing it
as the weighting strategy for your queries so that you don't have to weight
it yourself.
## Using Sparse Indexes
### Upserting Sparse Vectors
You can upsert sparse vectors into Upstash Vector indexes in two different ways.
#### Upserting Sparse Vectors
You can upsert sparse vectors by representing them as two arrays of equal
sizes. One signed 32-bit integer array for non-zero dimension indices,
and one 32-bit float array for the values.
Note that, we do not allow sparse vectors to have more than `1_000` non-zero valued dimension.
#### Upserting Text Data
If you created the sparse index with an Upstash-hosted sparse embedding model,
you can upsert text data, and Upstash can embed it behind the scenes.
### Querying Sparse Vectors
Similar to upserts, you can query sparse vectors in two different ways.
#### Querying with Sparse Vectors
You can query sparse vectors by representing the sparse query vector
as two arrays of equal sizes. One signed 32-bit integer array for
non-zero dimension indices, and one 32-bit float array for the values.
We use the inner product similarity metric while calculating the
similarity scores, only considering the matching non-zero valued
dimension indices between the query vector and the indexed vectors.
Note that, the similarity scores are exact, not approximate. So, if there
are no vectors with one or more matching non-zero valued dimension indices with
the query vector, the result might be less than the provided top-K value.
#### Querying with Text Data
If you created the sparse index with an Upstash-hosted sparse embedding model,
you can query with text data, and Upstash can embed it behind the scenes
before performing the actual query.
#### Weighting Query Values
For algorithms like BM25, it is important to take the inverse
document frequencies that make matching rare terms more important
into account. It might be tricky to maintain that information
yourself, so Upstash Vector provides it out of the box. To make use
of IDF in your queries, you can pass it as a weighting strategy.
Since this is mainly meant to be used with BM25 models, the IDF
is defined as:
```
IDF(qᵢ) = log((N - n(qᵢ) + 0.5) / (n(qᵢ) + 0.5))
```
- `N` is the total number of documents in the collection.
- `n(qᵢ)` is the number of documents containing term `qᵢ`.
