## Metadata
Metadata feature allows you to store context with your vectors to make a connection.
There can be a couple of uses of this:
1. You can put the source of the vector in the metadata to use in your application from the query response.
2. You can put some metadata to further filter the results upon the query.
You can set metadata with your vector as follows:
When you do a query or fetch, you can opt-in to retrieve the metadata as follows:
- **Query Example**
```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": "id-0",
      "score": 1,
      "metadata": {
        "url": "https://imgur.com/z9AVZLb"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "id-3",
      "score": 0.99961007,
      "metadata": {
        "url": "https://imgur.com/zfOPmnI"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Also, you can filter the results further by providing a metadata filter:
See [Metadata Filtering documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/filtering) for more details.
- **Range Example**
```json
{
  "result": {
    "nextCursor": "4",
    "vectors": [
      { "id": "id-0", "metadata": { "url": "https://imgur.com/z9AVZLb" } },
      { "id": "id-1", "metadata": { "url": "https://imgur.com/a2nCEIt" } },
      { "id": "id-2", "metadata": { "url": "https://imgur.com/zfOPmnI" } }
    ]
  }
}
```
## Data
Data is another kind of information you can store per vector
to attribute some context to it. Compared to metadata, it is not
structured, and it can only be fetched in queries, not used
to further filter them.
It is especially useful when you upsert raw text data, so that you
would have access to the textual form of vector along with the
embedded vector values.
It can save you from storing contextual information per vector
in a separate database.
You can set both the metadata and data, or only one of them
while upserting your vectors as follows:
When a raw text data is upserted, the data will be set to
the raw text data automatically:
Similar to metadata, the data field can be requested in queries, range
iterator, and fetch requests, by setting the `includeData` to `true` as
shown above.
