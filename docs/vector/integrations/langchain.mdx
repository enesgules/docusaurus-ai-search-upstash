title: "LangChain with Upstash Vector"
---
You can use LangChain with Upstash Vector to perform semantic search and manage vector embeddings. LangChain is a powerful framework that integrates with vector databases, including Upstash Vector, making it easy to build intelligent applications.
First, we need to create a Vector Index in the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com). To learn more about index creation, you can check out [this page](https://docs.upstash.com/vector/overall/getstarted).
## Install
```bash
pip install upstash-vector langchain langchain-community python-dotenv
```
## Usage
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_community.vectorstores.upstash import UpstashVectorStore
from langchain.schema import Document
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
# Create a vector store instance
store = UpstashVectorStore(
    embedding=True,  # Embedding option enabled
)
# Sample documents to upload
documents = [
    Document(page_content="Upstash Vector is a scalable vector database."),
    Document(page_content="LangChain is a framework for building intelligent apps."),
    Document(page_content="Semantic search enables advanced query matching."),
]
# Add documents to the Upstash Vector index
store.add_documents(documents)
# Perform a similarity search
query = "What is LangChain?"
results = store.similarity_search(query, k=3)
print("Similarity Search Results:")
for res in results:
    print(res.page_content)
```
### Query Results
```plaintext
Similarity Search Results:
LangChain is a framework for building intelligent apps.
Semantic search enables advanced query matching.
Upstash Vector is a scalable vector database.
```
## Features
**Semantic Search**: Retrieve the most contextually relevant results using embeddings and vector similarity.
**Namespace Support**: Separate documents into different namespaces for better organization.
**Metada Filtering**: Metadata can be used to filter the results of a query.
## Notes
- Upstash Vector supports custom embeddings; you can specify an embedding model when initializing `UpstashVectorStore`.
- Use `.env` files to manage your Upstash credentials for secure and reusable configuration.
