title: "Getting Started"

If you do not have a vector database already, follow [these steps](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/getstarted) to create one.
In the database details section of the Upstash Console, scroll down to `Connect` section and select the `cURL` tab. You can simply copy the curl expression and run on your terminal.
```shell
curl $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL/upsert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"id": "id-0", "vector": [0.87, 0.99]}'
```
## Response
REST API returns a JSON response. When command execution is successful, response JSON will have a single result field and its value will contain the Redis response.
Example:
```json
{ "result": "Success" }
```
When command execution is not successful, response JSON will have a single error field and its value will contain the error message.
Example:
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized: Invalid auth token",
  "status": 401
}
```
