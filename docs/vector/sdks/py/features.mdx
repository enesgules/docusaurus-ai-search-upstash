# Retry Mechanism
The `upstash-vector` SDK incorporates a reliable retry mechanism to manage network or API issues.
In the event of a failed request, the SDK automatically attempts up to three retries,
with each attempt spaced one second apart.
For customization of the retry behavior, you have the flexibility to set the `retries` and
`retry_interval` (in seconds) parameters according to your specific requirements.
For instance:
```python
from upstash_vector import Index
# Try 5 times with a 2-second interval between retries
index = Index.from_env(retries=5, retry_interval=2.0)
```
