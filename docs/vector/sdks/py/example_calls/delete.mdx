title: "Delete"
---
## Method
The `delete` method allows you to remove vectors from the index based on their identifiers. It returns the following field in response:
- `deleted`: An integer indicating how many vectors were deleted with the command.
## Delete Example
```python
from upstash_vector import Index
index = Index.from_env()
# Specify the identifiers of vectors to be deleted
ids_to_delete = ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
# Delete the specified vectors
delete_result = index.delete(ids=ids_to_delete)
# Display the number of vectors deleted
print("Number of Vectors Deleted:", delete_result.deleted)
```
Alternatively, you can delete a singular vector:
```python
index.delete("id-4")
```
Also, you can specify a namespace to operate on. When no namespace
is provided, the default namespace will be used.
```python
index.delete("id-4", namespace="ns")
```
